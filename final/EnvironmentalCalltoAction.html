      <h3>What is poaching?</h3>
<p>Poaching is the illegal hunting, killing, or capturing of animals. People
usually poach to produce products from the remains, such as: clothes,
jewwlry, fabric etc. Poaching usually occurs within wildllife reserves, in which
poachers illegally trespass, kill and escape; leaving the remains for the workers
to dispose of.
<br>
<br>
Animals that are most vulnearable are those bearing ivory. Ivory can be used
to produce pianos, jewelry, electrical appliances etc. A single pound of ivory
can cost up to <strong>$1,500</strong> and one tusk can weigh up to 250 pounds. Now, you're
probably wondering, where do you get ivory from? Although rhinos are often
poached for their horns, <strong> elephants </strong> carry the most ivory. One fully
fully grown elephant can hold up to $750,000 of merchandise. Their tusks and
teeth are immensely "valuable" on the black market. But <strong>who</strong> is carrying out these
horrendous acts? Let's explore that... </p>

       <center><h3>Who are poachers? How do we stop them?<center></h3>
       <p>Poachers come from all over. Most commonly, poachers are disguised
as tourists visiting a foreign country. China has the worlds largest
illegal ivory market, but it has not been illegal for much time. Elephants mostly
reside in Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania, and suprisingly enough, not all Poachers
are foreigners. In 2016, the Kenyan National Park was amidst a scandal in which over 4
elephants were found poached and dead on the park grounds. It was proven that some of
the Kenyan park rangers had corroborated with Chinese dealers, and helped them carry this
out, in exchange for payment. So, how do we stop this from occuring? <strong> By sending
a message. </strong> In April of 2016, Kenyan national parks safely removed the tusks
of thousands of elephants, in order to protect them from further poaching. Instead of selling
the remaining tusks, they sent the world a message. Led by then-President Uhuru Kenyatta,
Kenya burnt over 100 tons of ivory. This changed global policy and the trade of
ivory became illegal under the <strong>"Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species"
</strong> It was only on December 31st, 2017 that the Chinese govenment made the sale of ivory illegal.
This came after immense international pressure from other nations. This goes to show how
change can be peacefully enforced. Although this does not necessarily mean that poaching
 doesn not occur, April 29th 2016 was a great day for East Africa and the protection
of elephants in that region.  </p>
