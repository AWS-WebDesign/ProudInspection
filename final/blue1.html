  this project was our collection project. the main goal was creating links that can be reached through images.
  we also incorperated tables, which allowed us to give more information about our collection prices, and their brand
  information. this was a group project, that really allowed me, as a coder, to understand the difference between
  working alone and having a collaborative effort. navigating how to code as a group, and dividing time was pretty
  mind-opening.
