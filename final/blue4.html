  this project was a culmination of what i had learned during the semester. the goal was
  to create a website about an internet-related issue, and incorportate some of the aspects
  that we had learned before. i learned about how to smoothly put in animations, transitions, images,
  and videos, so that they come together nicely. this was a great way to end the year, as i was able to
  reflect on what i had learned and then put it into action.
