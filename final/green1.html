  this was one of my favourite projects. the goal was to research an issue that
  you are passionate about (poaching) and create an aesthetically pleasing
  website about it. through this, i learned about using divs to make more complex
  styles, inserting videos to make your webiste more interactive, and how writing
  about something you're passionate about, often leads to a better result.
