  <p>this is the place to be when you want to learn about the basics of code. it teaches you
  all about animations, transitions, and even how to insert images. i referenced these
pages many times during my early coding, and they were instrumental in helping my knowledge grow.</p>

    obviously, none of this would have been possible without the help of mr.considine. my advice to
    other coders is to reach out to your peers, classmates, and teachers for help when in doubt.
    this semester really changed the way i saw computer science, as i used to think that it was over-complicated
    and too meticulous for me to understand, but i was obviously mistaken.
