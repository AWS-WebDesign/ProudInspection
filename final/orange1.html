  our first official project was a research project about an animal. the overall goal of this project was to establish how to create background colors for text, create lists, and
  insert images. when you click on the screenshot and scroll down, you will see the two images of minks that i
  chose. within this, i learned how to change the size of images, and how to place them. looking back, this
  was a great stepping stone to becoming the coder i am now.
