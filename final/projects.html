  <p>this was a month of exploration. coming into web design, with no prior experience, i was nervous about whether i would
  click with the content. these folders hold the baby steps that were taken to even mildly understand what computer science entailed. </p>

 <p>october was a month of development. my webpages were beginning to become more complex,
 and colorful. i started arranging my webpages as being several webpages that came together,
that allowed my websites to flow and appear more professional. this was definitely a time
where coding started to become easier and more of a creative outlet. </p>

 <p>december was more of a note-taking focused month. we learnt a lot about the
 history of coding, and the internet. it was really a time for us to delve ourselves
into why technology and the web is the way it is today. we had one project,
described below, that concluded our year.   </p>
