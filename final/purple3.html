  this was the first assignment where we learned abut transitions. it was really interesting
  learning how to make transitions with different colors to make for a more fun experience.
  the animation is the movement of the image, and this was acheived by using the key frames
  option. this taught me about other features that i could use as well, and featured heavily in my future
  projects.
