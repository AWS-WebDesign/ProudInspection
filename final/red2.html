this was the first of more complex websites that i designed. the goal was creating
navigatable webpages, and using more complex styles such as background images. The biggest
take away was creating navigation bars, which would feature largely in my following webpages.
it was really interesting how much the use of different colors, and features such as the hover
option could really deepen a user's experience. this project taught me a lot about the importance
of making websites, not only pleasing to the eye, but easy and functional to use as well.
